# As serial port, you could assign physical ports like ttyS0 or ptys.
# ax25ipd supports BSD-style pseudo-terminals as well as the Unix98 pty's.
# If the tty argument is "/dev/ptmx", then Unix98 behaviour
# will automatically take effect. With Unix98 pty's, the slave tty name
# could not be forseen. That's why ax25ipd will print the corresponding
# slave pty name as a separate line on stdout.
